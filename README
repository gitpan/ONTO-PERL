ONTO-PERL suite
===============

ONTO-PERL a collection of PERL modules for dealing with OBO-formatted
ontologies (like the Gene Ontology). This code distribution gathers 
object-oriented modules (for dealing with ontology elements such as 
Term, Relationship and so forth), scripts (for typical tasks such as 
format conversions: obo2owl, owl2obo; besides, there are also many 
examples that can be easily adapted for specific applications), and a 
set of test files to ensure the suite's implementation quality.
