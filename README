ONTO-PERL modules
=================

'ONTO-PERL' a collection of perl modules for dealing with the Cell
Cycle Ontology (CCO) and in general with OBO ontologies (like the
Gene Ontology). This code distribution gathers object-oriented 
modules (for dealing with the ontology elements such as Term, 
Relationship, and so forth), scripts (for typical tasks such as 
format conversions: obo2owl, owl2obo; besides, there are also
many examples that can be easily adapted for specific applications), 
and a set of test files for ensuring the implementation quality.
