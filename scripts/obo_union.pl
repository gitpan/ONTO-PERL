# Script  : obo_union.pl
# Purpose : Finds the union ontology from the given OBO-formatted ontologies.
#           Creates an ontology having the union of terms and relationships from the given ontologies.
#           Remark 1 - The IDspace's are collected and added to the result ontology
#           Remark 2 - the union is made on the basis of the IDs
#           Remark 3 - the default namespace is taken from the last ontology argument
#           Remark 4 - the merging order is important while merging definitions: the one from the last ontology will be taken
# Usage   : obo_union.pl my_first_ontology.obo my_second_ontology.obo > union.obo
