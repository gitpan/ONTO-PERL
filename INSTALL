INSTALL
=======

There are two typical ways:

Using CPAN.  
==========

You'll want to use CPAN to install the modules by performing the 
following steps:

From the root prompt on your server, invoke the CPAN shell:

# perl -MCPAN -e shell

Once the PERL interpreter has loaded (and been configured), you can 
install modules by issuing the command install MODULENAME.

The first thing you should do is upgrade your CPAN:

cpan> install Bundle::CPAN

Once it's done, type:

cpan> reload cpan

Now, enter the following command to retrieve all of the required modules:

cpan> install OBO::Core::Ontology

Manually
========

By typing the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install
